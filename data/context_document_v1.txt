Table 2
Points for Class XII/ Engineering Diploma Results#
Marks* (y in %)	CGPA$ (c)	Points
y > 95	c > 9.5	8
90 < y <= 95	9.0 < c <=9.5	7
85 < y <= 90	8.5 < c <=9.0	6
80 < y <= 85	8.0 < c <=8.5	5
75 < y <= 80	7.5 < c <=8.0	4

65 <= y < = 70	6.5 < c <=7.0	2
60 <= y < = 65	c =6.5	1
y < 60	c < 6.5	0
Engineering Diploma Results will be considered only for those candidates who have done Engineering Diploma after Class X.
For computing the percentage of marks obtained in Class XII, the aggregate marks of all subjects that appear in the mark sheet or grade sheet would be considered irrespective of whether the Board considers them for calculation of percentage.
If the CGPA is on a different scale than 10, the equivalent CGPA on a 10-point scale will be considered.
For work experience, a maximum of seven points will be awarded based on the length of service, represented as x, (in completed months) as on 31st December 2023 as given in the Table 3. Only work experience after the completion of the qualifying degree will be considered. Internship/apprenticeship/articleship/training/project/work done as an integral part of curricular requirement or any type of unpaid work will not be considered.
