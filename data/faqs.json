    "question": "Q1. Who is eligible to apply for the PGDBA Exam 2025?",
    "answer": "A candidate must hold a graduate/post-graduate degree with 10+2+4 or 10+2+5 or 10+2+3+2, with at least 60% marks or CGPA 6.5 on a 10-point scale in the Qualifying Degree (i.e., B.Tech./ B.E./ M.Sc./ M.Com. or equivalent). A one-year MBA will not be considered the equivalent of an M.Sc./ M.Com. Candidates with 10+3 (Engineering diploma) + 3 (lateral entry into B.E./ B.Tech.) with at least 60% marks or CGPA 6.5 on a 10-point scale in the Qualifying Degree (i.e., B.Tech./ B.E.), or with 10+2+4 (B.Sc.) with at least 60% marks or CGPA 6.5 on a 10-point scale in the Qualifying Degree (i.e., B.Sc.), or with qualified CA/CS/ICWA with at least 60% marks (Intermediate and Final examinations of the CA/CS/ICWA considered together) are also eligible. For SC/ ST and Person with Disabilities (PwD) category candidates, the qualifying marks for eligibility shall be 55% or a CGPA of 6.0 on a 10-point scale. The CGPA will not be converted into percentage marks even if the degree-awarding Institute provides marks in the CGPA system. Their admission will be based on the CGPA awarded in the transcript. If the CGPA is on a different scale than 10, the eligibility of a candidate will be based on the equivalence of the CGPA on a 10-point scale. Candidates in their final year are also eligible to apply, provided they appear in the final examination and complete the other academic requirements specified above by Monday, June 30, 2025. In such cases, admission will be provisional, subject to submitting the final mark sheet by Monday, December 1, 2025.",
